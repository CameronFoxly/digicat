# DIGI-CAT

DIGI-CAT is a virtual pet terminal game built with React. Keep your ASCII cat alive by feeding and petting it! The cat's hunger and happiness decrease over time. If either reaches zero, the cat dies and its eyes turn to X's.

### [Live demo](https://cameronfoxly.github.io/digicat/) 

## Features
- Animated ASCII art cat that blinks
- Hunger and happiness stats displayed as bars
- Type commands (`feed`, `pet`) to interact with your cat
- If hunger or happiness reaches zero, the cat dies (X eyes) and you see a game over message
- Restart button to play again
- Simple terminal-style UI

## Commands
- `feed` — Increases hunger
- `pet` — Increases happiness

## How to Play
1. Start the app with `npm start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Watch your cat and keep an eye on its stats
3. Type `feed` or `pet` in the command input to care for your cat
4. If you neglect your cat, it will die and its eyes will become X's
5. Click "Restart" to try again

## Development
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts
- `npm start` — Run the app in development mode
- `npm test` — Run tests
- `npm run build` — Build for production

See the original Create React App README below for more details.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
